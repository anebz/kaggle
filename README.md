# My kaggle scripts and notebooks

This repository consists of my finished public Kaggle scripts and notebooks, which can also be found in my [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/anebzt).

At present I have two finished projects:

   * _5-day data challenge_: forked tutorial kernels about preprocessing and visualization
   * _MNIST with CNN in Keras_: personal kernel built from scratch which could serve as a tutorial for computer vision beginners  I include the code for preprocessing and CNN, as well as complementary explanations about the theory or personal experiences and conclusions obtained form experiments.

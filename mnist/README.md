# MNIST with CNN in Keras - Detailed explanation

This is the IPython notebook I have in my kernel in my [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/anebzt/mnist-with-cnn-in-keras-detailed-explanation).

In it I include the code to classify digits and I include comments and detailed explanatinos, both theoretical as well as practical experiments and results and conclusions.
